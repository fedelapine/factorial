# factorial
A simple program that stores name and surname and calculates a factorial.

This is my first ever Java assessment that I completed at the end of semester one for my Software Development class in my HNC Computing (equivalent of first year of degree).

Along with the program, I also submitted a test log and data dictionaries of both variables and functions.
